Node.js vs django 

Even though Node.js and Django are very different tools, teams frequently discuss them when deciding which technology to utilise to create online applications.
Similar to how Django makes it possible to use Python in both the front end and the back end of your web app, Node.js also makes it possible to utilise JavaScript,
which is generally only used for front end development, for server-side scripting.
The best way to choose between Django and Node.js for your project is to compare their strong and weak points and find out what kinds of projects they are typically used for. 
This is because both Django and Node.js are simply excellent at what they do.
Django is a powerful full-stack Python web framework that comes fully loaded with features that take care of all common web development issues. 
That includes user authentication and content administration.
Even though it gets bundled with frameworks a lot, Node.js isn’t one – it’s actually a JavaScript runtime environment, built on Chrome’s JavaScript engine.
Made for writing server-side applications with JavaScript, Node.js is the technology of choice for a large and growing number of developers.
