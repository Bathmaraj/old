**Kickstart Your Programming Career: 4 Coding Careers for Beginners**

**Here are 4 beginner-friendly coding jobs:**
1. Junior web developer

*By far, this is the most common route our coding graduates go. Web Developers utilize coding languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails to code applications and websites. To get these applications and websites working, web developers need to write the code for the front-end and back-end so their applications and websites can function correctly. If you end up on a small team, you may be coding on both the front-end and back-end, but it is more common for web developers to specialize in either the front-end or the back-end. Specializing in one is advantageous because the work required is different, and more often than not, you will have a preference for one over the other. So, it is essential to experience both and decide which one suits you best.Front-end web developers are responsible for what the user (person browsing the website) sees. As a front-end developer, you may either work from a design made by a web designer, or you may be the one designing the website. It is essential to have the right aesthetics and be user-friendly for the user. Not doing this may lead to the user leaving the website entirely and the company losing business. You may lean towards front-end development if you have an eye for aesthetics or experience in graphic design. It pays well too. Salary.com lists the median salary for a front-end developer is at $119,224.Back-end web developers are responsible for everything the user doesn’t see. This means they work on what happens on the server side, like web application logic and integration. They make sure that web pages and applications function correctly and are responsible for making appropriate adjustments to improve functionality when needed. As for salary, Indeed lists the average base salary at $120,728 per year.*

2. Junior web designer

*As you might have guessed, web designers design websites. They tackle the visual components of websites and tailor them to what their client needs to accomplish. They need to have a keen eye for detail and know when to be creative. You may lean towards being a web designer if you like to make things as aesthetically pleasing as possible. Or, you may like web design because it isn’t as heavily reliant on coding. Web designers usually use HTML and CSS to make their mockups for their clients.*

*Web design is different from front-end development because the web designer is tasked with the website’s look while the front-end developer is charged with the implementation. Although, sometimes, a front-end developer may work on the design if the team is small.*

*Taking a look at the salary, Indeed lists the average base salary at $47,643 per year.*

3. Data analyst

*Data analysts, of course, analyze data. They collect, clean, and interpret data sets to answer a question or solve a problem. You will be spending a lot of time with the data you order, so you must understand it well enough to communicate it clearly and concisely to your clients. It would be best if you often used spreadsheets like Excel or Sheets and coding languages like SQL, R, or Python to accomplish your tasks.*

*Salary depends on which area you would like to be a data analyst (Medical/Healthcare, Marketing, Business, Operations, Intelligence). So, according to Salary.com, it ranges from $68,596 and $87,155 in the United States.*

4. Become a freelancer

*Work from where you want and when you want as a freelancer. A freelance coder works on a contractual basis with clients to develop software or applications for their specific needs. This means you can also specialize in whatever language or area of coding you would like. In addition, you don’t have to take on clients if the project is not of interest to you or doesn’t pay as well as you hoped for the work needed.*

*Salary will vary, of course, being a freelancer. It will depend on the number of contracts you take and how much each project will payout. You will also have to factor in finding clients to work with. It will be vital to building relationships with clients you have worked with to keep getting contracts from them or their network.*
