# Bleeding Edge Technology:- 

-Bleeding edge refers to a product or service, usually involving technology, that is available to consumers but is so new and experimental that it has not been fully tested and, consequently, may be unreliable. Early adopters could experience design flaws and bugs that have not been observed by the developers. It is also a given that bleeding-edge products may never gain mainstream acceptance.

This process enables the company to quickly identify any problems and determine whether the item is popular and functional enough to merit further investment.

### Bleeding Edge vs. Cutting Edge 
Bleeding edge refers to technology that is further ahead than cutting-edge or leading-edge technology. It is a technology that is so new and advanced that it is still unproven, could carry risks, and may not perform as intended. 
Where  "Cutting edge" means it is brand new, usually referring to technology. It's something that has never been done before

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Bleeding Edge
It is particularly common for certain types of software, especially open-source software, to be released in this form. By doing so, it allows the company to give users access to it to test out and contribute to the technology. The firm can also be made aware of and smooth out any flaws, and gather input into what consumers find may help boost the user experience. 

But there are also disadvantages to using bleeding edge technology. There is a chance of consumer backlash, especially when the technology is far too flawed. And that means that the company could end up with the heavy expense of having a product on the market that people just do not want to buy. 

so Where is your organization when it comes to technology adoption â€” Bleeding Edge, Cutting Edge ?

Thanks for Reding...
