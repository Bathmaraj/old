### My First Hackathon

I am from University of Engineering and Management Jaipur currently pursuing B.Tech in CSE currently in 3rd year. I attended my first hackathon which was 12 hours long in-person event in this year in my college only. The event was organised by the college itself and some of the communities.

It was 14th September 2022, started from 9am, me and my team reached there half an hour earlier. Our registration is done and we got our participation identity card. After that we straight away moved to the center and took your seats. We are waiting that when will be the event will start, after some lectures, finally everyone is allotted to their respective rooms and the hackathon was started.

My team name was Stuck_In_Loop and with me my room-mate was there. In the beginning we were very energetic and concerned about our project. We are building an app that’s related to our everyday life related to our college. Actually we can say that we were working on a real life problems. Our project problem statement was organising your college routine, assignments and our daily life task. So, the app we were building I can say that that a organiser app. The technology we used were flutter.

After 2–3 hours our energy level is decreasing slowly, but still we were working on our project. At 1pm we had taken our lunch and again at 1:30 we started working. The environment was so cool and its looking like competitive. Each and Everyone is working very hard. At 4pm we had a small interview of your project in that basis top 30 teams will be selected.

And yes finally we got selected, and we may continue your project. It was very happy moment for us that from 150 teams we came in between 30. So our energy level got high enough and we pushed ourselves into the project tightly. Moreover we had build the user interface only, we didn’t connect to the database. At 8pm we completed our project and went for dinner. After half an hour we started building our presentation and that was every thing for a project. If anyone want to show case their idea of project in very common way then presentation is the most important thing. So from 9am to 9pm we worked a lot and college management provide us snacks and drinks in every two hours. That is very essential for work on. So, at-last around 9:45 pm everyone submitted their project and presentation and everyone had to present their ideas or project in the stage in-front of everyone. We were at 23rd and we presented our project around 12:30 am the next day. Freak that’s to long. So, our presentation went so good and I was presented the whole PPT and my friend accompanied me.

Now, the big moment, its time for result declaration…

According to college, 1st team will get 5000 cash prize, 2nd team will get 3000 cash prize and 3rd team will get 2000 cash prize.

So, first they announced about the 3rd position, one of the team member in the 3rd position was my room-mate so good to see that my room-mate got the third position. Now we lost our hope and taking to my room-mate congratulating him, and the judge announced the 2nd position Stuck_In_Loop, and literally after listening that I really got hanged.

So, this is the story of my first in-person hackathon and we succeed by securing second position ...
