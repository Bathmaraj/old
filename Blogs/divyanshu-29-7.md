With time, dedication, and internet access, anyone can learn to code. If you’re reading this, that includes you. That’s why, in this guide, we’ll unpack everything you need to know to start writing code, including:
- Why learn to code?
- How to Start Coding?
- Coding vs. Programming.
- Coding for Beginners.
  
### Step 1: Understand Why You Want To Start Programming?

  The first and one of the most important steps on how to become a programmer is identifying your reasons for starting. Sit down and have a good hard think about the following questions, as your answers will help you decide exactly which path to take.This will also help you determine which programming language you decide to learn first, what sorts of projects you want to complete, and ultimately what you want to make of your skills.
### Step 2: Figure out how to start coding? What field you want to go into?

  When you are figuring out how to learn programming, you need to think very carefully about what field you are planning on looking for work in. Some of the most popular types of programmers include web development, data scientist, mobile application devloper, database administrator etc.
  Thanks to the internet, there’s never been a better time to learn to code. But the sheer volume of options can stall some new coders before they even begin. In this section, we’ll cover how to learn coding for beginners, with some recommended resources for each step.
1. Figure out why you want to learn to code.   
  It's tempting to jump right in when you start coding. But if you don't have an end goal you may become frustrated and stop learning before you get to the fun. So, before you start studying, think about why you want to know how to code. Think about the projects you want to complete, why this skill excites you, and what resources you have available.
2. Choose which coding language you want to learn first.   
    As a beginner, you may want to start with a language that doesn't use data structures or algorithms. If that's the case, HTML or CSS are great places to start. But languages like Java and Python are also great for beginners, and they also have a wide range of applications.

3. Take online courses.  
  Learning to code no longer requires a classroom setting. Today, there are thousands of online programming courses that cover everything from basic HTML to data structures to complex algorithms. Your first course should introduce the basics of a language and contain interactive modules and assignments to guide your learning. Courses create a structure for learning, which is essential as concepts in computer science build on each other. An organized course keeps everything digestible and ensures you’re learning things in the correct order.
  You can always look up to some popular free course providers such as [**w3schools**](https://www.w3schools.com/), [**GeekforGeeks**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/), [**freeCodeCamp**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
4. Watch video tutorials.   
  While online courses are your best bet for hands-on experience, online videos can supplement your learning and occupy your curiosity. My personal favorites include: [**CodeWithHarry**](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeWithHarry) and [**Kunal Kushwaha**](https://www.youtube.com/c/KunalKushwaha).
5. Read books and ebooks.  
  - HTML/CSS: The Beginner's Guide to HTML and CSS for Marketers
- JavaScript: Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming
- Python: Python Crash Course
- C: C Programming Absolute Beginner's Guide
- C++: C++ Primer
- C#: C# 8.0 and .NET Core 3.0 – Modern cross-platform development: Build applications with C#
- Java: Effective Java
- PHP: Head First PHP & MySQL
- Ruby: The Well-Grounded Rubyist
- SQL: SQL in 10 minutes, Sams Teach Yourself
- Swift: Swift Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide
6. Use tools that make learning to code easier.  
  While it's great to know that you don't need any special tools to write code, there are tools that can help. Code editors such as **visual studios code** can be really helpful.
### Step 3: Difference between coding and programming.
  The terms coding and programming are often used interchangeably, but they don't always mean the same thing. Both coding and programming mean writing instructions for a computer. But programming might also include algorithms and data structures. Generally, the term programming describes more advanced projects.
  While you can code with just a computer and some time, some programming might need specialized software tools. Programming projects are usually bigger and more complex. They may need project management and a more solid knowledge base. Coding requires knowledge of at least one coding language, a set of syntax and rules that computers can understand. There are hundreds of coding languages, each one unique in its purpose and what it can do.

But some languages are easier to learn than others — these are best to start with since they’re the fastest way to learn the fundamentals of programming.

Programming languages give you a structure for the instructions you're writing. This language looks like English, but not exactly. Programmers call the terms and grammar in a programming language syntax. Low-level languages like Assembly or Machine are easier for machines to read than humans, so they can be tough to learn. So, middle-level or high level language can be useful for beginner programmers.

### Step 4: Coding for Beginners.
There are many ways to approach the practice of coding, and some methods and languages will work better for you than others.

No matter what or how you learn, however, remember these beginner tips:  
- Be patient.
- Get comfortable with fundamentals like variables, functions, conditional logic, arrays and objects.
- Write clean code from the start.
Here’s something an online course may not teach you: On top of learning how to write your code, you should also practice writing it well. 
- Why is clean code important? You might be wondering why you need to learn clean code at this point. You’re a beginner, so shouldn’t writing functional programs be the main goal?
Well, yes. This is about establishing good habits early. If you put in the extra work now, you’ll save yourself (and others) some sanity down the road.
A good way to achieve this is by keeping your lines and your functions short. I recommend limiting each line of code to 80 characters max and each function to no more than 15 lines.
While limiting at first, these rules will train you to favor efficient code over the first idea that occurs to you.
- ***Practice, practice and practice more because one can never be perfect but one can always improve***.
