I am sure his story will inspire you

 ## “Google search went down for a few hours in 2002; Jeff Dean handled all the queries by hand and checked quality doubled.”- Jeff Dean Facts.

It’s not true, of course; one of many popular Jeff Dean jokes, but you get the idea why people say that.

In mid-2000, six of Google’s best engineers gathered in a makeshift war room. Google’s core system, which indexed the Web by crawling it, had stopped functioning. Although the users could still enter their queries, the results were outdated by five months.

Google just had an agreement with Yahoo to power a search engine for it, which would be ten times bigger than the one they had at the time. The tension was rising. A lot was at stake. The Yahoo agreement would probably fall through if they were unsuccessful, and the firm would run the danger of losing its funds and going bankrupt. Everything they had been working for could end up in smoke.

A rangy, tall, energetic thirty-one-year-old man named Jeff dean was among those six brilliant engineers in the makeshift room. He had just left D. E. C. a couple of months ago and started his career in a relatively new firm Google, which was about to change the world. He rolled his chair over his colleague Sanjay and sat right next to him, cajoling his code like a movie director. The history started from there.

When you think of people who shaped the World Wide Web, you probably picture founders and CEOs like Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Marc Andreesen, Tim Berners-Lee, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg. They’re undoubtedly the brightest people on earth.

Meanwhile, legions of anonymous coders toil away at keyboards daily to create the systems and products we all use in the shadow of these giants. These employees are irreplaceable, especially in the computer industry.

 ### Let’s learn more about him
This could be why you probably never heard of Jeff Dean’s name. He is an American software engineer and computer scientist. Dean is the mastermind of many behind-the-scenes products that helped Google rule the internet. Jeff, co-founder, and head of Google’s deep learning research engineering team, is now a well-known keynote speaker on technology, innovation, and artificial intelligence.

He worked at the University of Washington as a teaching assistant, instructor, and research assistant while pursuing an MS and Ph.D. in computer science. After graduating, Dean joined the research team at Compaq Computer Corporation’s Western Research Laboratory.

Jeff co-created the Continuous Profiling Infrastructure for Digital and was the creator of ProfileMe while working at Compaq. In addition, he was a co-designer and implementer of Swift, one of the world’s fastest Java implementations. He also served as a senior member of the technical staff at mySimon Inc., retrieving and caching content for electronic commerce.

When Dean arrived at Google in mid-1999, he was already one of the country’s top young computer scientists. As a child, when personal computer power was just beginning to take off, he was constantly seeking ways to stretch the capability of any given computer.

A genius…
He claims that while he was in high school, his program for processing an enormous amount of epidemiological data was 26 times faster than what professionals used then. The Centers for Disease Control have implemented the Epi Info system, made available in 13 languages. Additionally, as a computer science Ph.D. student, he worked on compilers. These programs convert source code into a language that computers can easily understand.

Dean never wanted to work on compilers for the rest of his life. So he left Academia and joined Google, which had less than 20 people then. Dean contributed to Google News and AdSense in the early stage, which tremendously altered the internet economy. Soon after, he focused on Google’s one pressing issue, scaling.

As google was growing, it faced an enormous computing challenge. In the late 90s, they built PageRank, an algorithm that returned the most relevant results to a given search query. As Google grew in popularity, it couldn’t deploy machines fast enough to meet the demand.

Dean did what he did best, finding solutions. He, and fellow outstanding programmer Sanjay Ghemawat, created the Google File System, which effectively distributed large data over thousands of cheap machines.

At the same time, these two developed the revolutionary programming tool MapReduce, which helped programmers to handle enormous data volumes while using those parallel processors. They could also modify the search algorithm and add new calculations to it. MapReduce was so successful that it became an industry sensation when they explained it in a seminal 2004 research paper.

Some game-changer innovations
Many of Dean’s other initiatives were game changers as well. For instance, BigTable, a distributed data storage system that could manage petabytes of data, was based on the Google File system. Spanner, the first global database, is a method of storing data across millions of servers in dozens of data centers across many continents.

It today serves as the foundation for everything from Gmail to AdWords. You would be surprised to know that Jeff Dean was the co-founder of Google Translate. He is also a significant contributor to Google News. Currently, Dean leads the Google AI division and serves the company as the Senior Fellow (equivalent to Senior Vice President) of Google Research and Health.

 ### Recognitions
 - Dean was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2009. He received the fellowship of the Association for Computing Machinery in 2009 and the fellowship of the American Academy of Arts and Science in 2016. In 2012, he was entitled to the ACM- Infosys Foundation Award, and in 2007, ACM- SIGOPS Mark Weiser Award. The list could go on.

 - A sneaky question may arrive in your mind: How much does this big brain earn? Well, most believe he is one of the highest-paid employees at Google. According to a survey, he is paid $ 3 million a year.

Most mornings at Google, he joins a small group that gathers around a coffee machine to make espresso and socialize. Dean steams the milk, another person operates the grinder, and another brews the espresso. As the coffee is made, they talk about families and technical topics. This little collaboration and idea sharing makes Google keep going, he thinks.

 ### “Some of us have been working together for more than 15 years,” Dean said. “We estimate that we’ve collectively made more than 20,000 cappuccinos together.”
