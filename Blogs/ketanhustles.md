Are you a software engineering graduate? Or have you been working in software engineering for a few years, but don’t find yourself in a “good place,” and are wondering if you are doing something wrong?

Below I’ll share 11 non-technical lessons from my experience in software engineering that I wish somebody had told me when I first started.

Let me start with my experience and why reading this article could benefit you.

I worked in the software engineering field for over a decade as a developer, team lead, architect, and stakeholder. Eventually, I transitioned into entrepreneurship which gave me a glimpse of how it is to be on the other side of the table as an employer. I’ve worked in small and big companies, startups, and enterprises, with different methodologies, cultures, and languages across several countries.

I’ve had my fair share of successful projects and failures. I’ve seen projects that I’ve worked on hit the front pages of newspapers, or government ministers claiming credit for a successful launch, while others have been binned and forgotten before even going live.

And though I don’t regret my professional journey, if I were to do it again, I would do it with every hard-learned lesson listed below in mind. And I hope these lessons will help you avoid some of the same pitfalls in the future.

1. Start With What You Want in the Long Term
Looking for a job, we are often guided by simple, work-specific desires, such as money, professional growth, or a good atmosphere, and we tend to ignore how it would fit into our lifestyle.

The narrative that professional and personal lives are parallel and unrelated to each other is false. Even more than that, your work influences your personality in the long term.

I went for professional growth first, then atmosphere, then money. I ended up as a software consultant for a financial company. By most people’s standards, it was quite a nice job. It ticked many of the boxes of what we usually define as a good place of work. It was even an object of envy to some of my ex-colleagues and friends. But I hated it.

The work, the people, and the promoted values were empty to me. I tried to fill my life with fun outside of work to compensate. But it only highlighted that I was in the wrong place, living the wrong life.

Rather than building your lifestyle around your work, find a job that fits your desired lifestyle.

When making career decisions, try to look beyond your immediate needs, desires, or fears and consider how you would like your life to be in 5, 10, or 20 years.

2. Plan Your Next Career Move in Advance
If you come up with personal criteria for a place where you want to work, you’d likely realise that there are very few, if any, suitable “opportunities” available. Good places do not stay vacant for long. And that’s particularly true about unusual jobs with non-trivial benefits.

Additional work is required to identify these opportunities in advance and, ideally, get suitable expertise.

Frequently, I rushed my move. I usually had one or maybe two criteria for a new place, and I was too impatient to give myself enough time to research companies and prepare well for interviews. That usually resulted in positions that did not suit my ambitions and potential. Often, I reached the limit of that “opportunity” in a year or two and had to look for another one.

Identify companies that give you the opportunity to live the lifestyle you want. Find companies that promote the same values you have. See where like-minded people work and what’s in demand there. Then, check if it’s really as good as it seems.

Just like many stock investors have a shortlist of companies that they keep an eye on before investing, you, too, should have a list of favourite companies that you monitor before committing your time to them.

3. Environment Matters; Choose Wisely
Just as a child’s development is affected by the environment they were raised in, so is the professional development of junior engineers shaped by the companies they work in. Unlike a child, an engineer arguably doesn’t need love, but they definitely need a friendly environment, support, good mentorship, well-established processes, effective management, etc.

Often, the first companies we work with define the way we see our profession. A random decision, taken by chance, could define our career for a lifetime.

If the start of your career is not as smooth as you would like and you are struggling to complete assigned tasks, don’t jump to the conclusion that it’s not for you. A different environment may bring surprising changes.

I still vividly remember the beginning of my very first day at work as a software engineer. I had been given the date and time to show up without any follow-up after. I remember walking to the office with questions swirling in my mind: “Do I actually have the job?”, “Did I mix up the date and time?”, “Should I have brought something with me?”.

At the office, I was directed to my seat, where I stared at my PC for about an hour without a clue what I was supposed to do until the manager showed up. But even after that, the integration into the company was left primarily to me, and I can’t say I did an excellent job at it. I only met similarly lost colleagues who struggled with the same questions: “What are we doing here?”, “What is the purpose of the company?”, “Is it like this everywhere?”

As you can guess, I didn’t stay there long, nor did many others.

To avoid an unfavourable environment, focus your attention on how the company integrates newcomers and for how long they stay. Keep your needs in mind, and don’t fall for perks that don’t actually apply to juniors or newcomers.

Also, be wary of companies that primarily hire newcomers. Some companies exploit the “cheapness” of junior developers. Without introducing experienced engineers who know the market and have seen different work processes, companies can build whatever environment they want. From there, they can convince employees who have little experience working anywhere else that it’s normal.

4. Interview Companies
Candidates are often focused so much on giving off the best image of themselves at the interview, that they forget to “interview” the company. Companies can be very different. Similar positions can imply very different work, demands, atmosphere, etc. By interviewing the interviewer, you can also get the gist of how things are in the company and with whom you should end up working.

Some of the offers that I rejected or interviews that I failed turned out to be positive events, sometimes on par with the offers I accepted. Due to rejecting or failing these interviews, I escaped quite a few bad runs in my career.

Over time, I’ve developed some behavioural patterns to radiate my values, the kind of person I am, and what I am looking for in a new place. I am not a fan of conformity and formality, so I started to answer slightly provocatively to cliché questions. I also expressed my minimum demands frankly and underlined that they are the MINIMUM. Anyone proceeding with an interview and coming back with an offer below would only damage their reputation in my eyes.

And, of course, I’ve interviewed my interviewers. My favourite questions were:
1. What is prohibited in your company?
2. Describe a typical day of a software engineer (the position interviewed for) in your company and, if relevant, followed by: Describe your typical day in the office (usually addressed to Team Lead or Manager).

And a shirt with casual trousers is the most formal I’ve ever dressed for an interview.

Some companies liked it, some were OK with it, and others didn’t, which was a natural filtration. I didn’t need offers from any company — I wanted offers from the companies that were suitable for me.

Don’t be afraid to ask questions and make clear what you are looking for in the new place. By expressing your values, you also match them against the company’s values. If they accept it, the chances are high that you’ll be working with like-minded people in a friendly environment and enjoy the process.

It’s much better to be rejected at the interview than find yourself working in an environment you don’t like.

5. Constantly Improve Your Cross-Cultural Communication Skills
The ability to understand, be understood, and engage others in constructive discussions to find the best solution is critical for achieving outstanding results.

In multicultural environments, the complexity of communication can increase seemingly infinitely. The same word or action could be taken very differently by individuals from different cultures, which is why it is almost impossible to create universal communication rules that work well for everybody. Therefore, learning the communication specifics of different nationalities, companies, or teams is essential.

I saw how a London-based company once replaced their software consulting firm from China with another company from Ireland, citing the sole reason: cultural preferences. The communication and working differences with the Chinese were so significant that they were struggling to get their job done and ended up hiring a company with a similar culture.

Learning to interact with different cultures and personalities comes primarily from experience and keeping an open mind and curiosity alive. If you’ve moved to another country and found yourself in a completely different environment, try to step outside of your old social norms and embrace the new culture.

Later on, once settled, you can pick whatever you like from your own culture and mix it with newly acquired behavioural patterns. But first, you need to understand the culture of your colleagues and company — the values and dispositions which drive their behavioural and communication patterns.

Unfortunately, people often become reserved and limit their interaction to the bare minimum when facing significant cultural differences. This only prolongs the agony and doesn’t help develop the necessary skills to navigate a multicultural environment.

6. Understand the Business Value of Your Task
Have you ever been given a task or problem to solve and started to wonder how you could solve it before you even looked at all of the requirements?

Software developers often get so bogged down in technical excellency that they completely forget why the business needs the task done and is ready to pay for it in the first place. This results in missed deadlines, wrong functionality, tension between team members, general frustration, blame, and almost any other problem that you can think of, which can spread across the whole team or even department.

As a consultant, I once joined a team towards the end of the development phase of a significant project. They had been working on it for a couple of years and had well-established processes and agile practices. They used PRs, automated tests, code scanners, and dedicated QAs for quality. Requirements were meticulously defined by dedicated business and system analysts.

You might think they had completely thought it through and it was destined for success. However, it resulted in an unmaintainable project that was hardly ever used by the business. Each change request cost an arm and a leg, and the business parked it shortly after it went live.

Just before that experience, I had successfully led the delivery of a vital project, which went very differently. Everything was wrong, no defined methodology, no code quality checks, not even requirements! Here is the conversation I had with my manager at the very start of the project:

Manager: The project is massive, and we have a year to deliver it. We better get started.
Me: Yeah. Just give me the requirements.
Manager: There aren’t any. It’s yet to be agreed by the politicians in Brussels.
Me: But the project is big. We need to start as soon as possible to have a fair chance of finishing it in time.
Manager: Yes! That’s why I say that we need to start now!
Me: But what can we start with if there are no requirements?!
Manager: Well, let’s come up with something!
Me: O_O
Manager: There is a legacy project. The requirements for the new project will be different, but not entirely. So we can start by migrating the functionality of the legacy project and adjust it as the actual requirements come in.

So that’s how we proceeded. We kept receiving new requirements along the way, up to a couple of weeks before release. And it was a success. We hit all the defined goals. And we achieved it without many, if any, of the best practices that are commonly used. Instead, each task was first discussed as a business problem. Only after that did we think of a technical solution. We picked up the business lexicon and discussed the issues with stakeholders in their language, instead of forcing them to learn ours or demanding translators in the form of business or system analysts.

Moving from completing tasks to solving problems is a sure sign of progress towards seniority for an engineer. As a stakeholder, it makes such a difference when I can leave a problem with an engineer and not have to split it into tasks for him. A senior engineer can take whatever vague requirements or issues there are and, through communication with stakeholders and research, develop the most suitable solution.

7. Keep Networking
Software engineering is very different from industry to industry and even from company to company. Networking is an excellent way to expand your understanding of what it is like to work in various sectors and companies and possibly find a job opportunity not advertised on the market that fits you well.

The best jobs are not advertised; they are filled by referrals. We’ve all heard it, and most of us ignore it. But perhaps we shouldn’t.

The company I worked with that had the best atmosphere grew from 20+ to 50+ employees in the two years I was there. During that time, very few positions were publicly advertised. They didn’t need to be. Once a vacancy was emailed out internally, everyone referred their ex-colleagues, friends, and even relatives if they matched the requirements.

Networking can be very varied, and the way to do it depends on personality, so I am not going to advise on how to do it. But make sure to connect with people outside your work network and industry. Connecting only with those who have similar experiences significantly limits the benefits of networking.

Also, do it regularly. Randomly reaching out to somebody, with whom you haven’t communicated in years only when you’re looking for a new job, is not just awkward, it can be plain rude.

8. Don’t Trust Recruiters From Third Parties
If you follow points 2 and 7 from above, you won’t have much need to interact with recruiters. But if, like many others, you leave it open to chance, you need to understand that while for you changing jobs is a life-changing event, for them it’s just another sale. If you didn’t find the right company for yourself, do you really think somebody else will do it for you?!

I could write a book filled with all the lies and tricks I encountered from recruiters over the years. Apart from the most common “the company will invest in your professional development” and “the remuneration will be much better after the probation period,” I remember a couple of tricks that I almost or actually fell for that I think are worth sharing.

The usual playbook: during the first call, recruiters would often ask what I was looking for in a new place. Later they would pretend to find a suitable job opportunity. In reality, they would use my criteria to describe existing vacancies in an attempt to convince me to go forward with them.
An unusual trick: once a recruiter sent me requirements alongside company names. The first company had quite a nice reputation, and because the requirements were quite similar, I assumed the second company, which I hadn’t heard of, was almost as good. So when the first company didn’t get back to me regarding an interview, I accepted an interview with the second company.
Later, I found out that the first company had an exclusive agreement with another recruitment agency. No other recruiters could hire for that position. The recruiter just used it to lure me in for an interview with the second company.
An assignment with little chance: one time, after what I felt had been a failed technical interview, I received a call from a recruiter that I’d passed to the next round. It was strange considering it had been about two weeks since the interview. The recruiter assured me that the company had messed something up, and that’s why I hadn’t heard back earlier. The next round was an assignment. According to the recruiter, it was crucial to impress the company, even blow them away with my solution, which he repeated a couple of times. It should have made me suspicious, but I was naive and really looking forward to making up for the flopped interview. I agreed and spent an entire weekend working on it. After submitting the assignment, I never heard back from the recruiter or the company.
While you’re looking for a job, don’t hype up a vacancy or a company in your head, and don’t allow recruiters to do it for you. Instead, carefully consider everything that you’ve encountered and even talk it through with your family or close friends to see if you haven’t missed any red flags.

I find recruitment outdated. Emails with “opportunities” where a specialist seemingly has to be interested in a job by requirements only look increasingly odd. I don’t understand why anyone would be attracted to the possibility of working for a company just because it might be interested in hiring them.

I haven’t looked for a job in years now, but if I were looking for one, I would have my specific demands and no one but me would advocate for them.

You could do that too. Recruiters are surprisingly intolerant to demands like “I want to work four days a week, from home, with flexible hours,” “I want to double my current salary without doubling my work,” or “I want to work with that company. Can you get me an interview there?”

9. Get Multiple Offers
Somehow, even after working for many years for different companies, people are still under the illusion that if they demonstrate their expertise and provide great value, the employer will recognise it and raise their salary.

In reality, employee remuneration is determined not by the value that the employee brings to the company but by the market value of their skills, and having another offer is the best way to demonstrate the market value of your expertise.

For example, if an employee brings one million in revenue per year to a company, do you think this employee’s 500K salary is justified? Not if the company can find someone who would do it for less.

That’s why, in many cases, brilliant performance has minimal effect on remuneration, and it is only when an employee is leaving that the manager is ready to negotiate.

The same goes for interviews. They are used to clarify your expertise level but not your market value. Demands of same-level specialists determine the market value.

And nothing raises your value for an employer more than another, bigger offer on the table. It signals that their current evaluation of you or the market might be wrong, and they have to reconsider it to have a chance to keep benefitting from your services.

Just one simple example. I got a contract offer with a rate slightly below my demand, with a firm message — that’s the highest they can go. I thanked them and said I would think about it as I also had another offer. In 15 minutes, I got a call back that they could meet my demands.

Recruiters or employers can present you with a ton of arguments about why they cannot go any better than their current offer, and I am sure you have a ton more for why they should. It’s just words versus words. So cut it short and say: “Company X offered me Y amount with Z benefits. Can you beat that?” And yes, make sure to have that offer.

In the current conditions, the company’s representative can outline the hiring timeframe right from the start. And it’s usually quite similar, e.g. in Ireland, it’s about one month. So if you start the interviewing process within one week with a few companies, chances are high that you would get offers roughly at the same time. Take your time to consider them and negotiate.

The current demand in software engineering is crazy. Even graduates can have a few opportunities to choose from. If you are a graduate, remuneration should not be your priority, but there is no harm in starting practising remuneration negotiation early.

10. Always Negotiate Remuneration!
Your bargaining power is significantly reduced without a second offer, but that doesn’t mean that your answer options are limited to yes/no.

Negotiation, in this case, will unlikely have a significant impact on your remuneration. Still, it could reveal a lot about the company and how valued you are.

In one particular case, I got an offer slightly lower than my clearly outlined demands. It was quite an insignificant amount. I almost accepted it. But, if it’s a negligible amount for me, it must be even less for the company. So I pressed on with my initial demands.

In return, I got a description of numerous other perks available and promises that remuneration would increase shortly after my starting date, but not from the start. It was odd to see a company representative going to such lengths to convince me to accept the offer but not doing the simplest thing to ensure it. I rejected it.

Soon after, I found out from a friend working there that the company makes promises to everyone and never fulfils them. That change of mind as a result of negotiating the offer saved me from working for empty promises.

Sometimes, even small companies are surprisingly rigid and won’t discuss the offer. What do you imagine working for such a company would look like? Do you want to work there? Others, even big corporations, are surprisingly open to negotiating or arranging a meeting for you with your potential manager to address your concerns.

Unless you plan to work quietly and not voice your concerns or demands, you better start communicating with the employer before accepting the offer.

11. Be an Engineer
It might sound odd, but I could not leave it out. The demand in software engineering encourages more and more people to pick this career. Unfortunately, the number of those who become software engineers just for the high salaries is getting bigger year after year. And nothing is wrong with it. What’s wrong is to be an engineer without the desire to solve problems.

During my career, I saw quite a few software engineers who would be happy to do anything but code. They could not wait to “progress” to something adjacent to software development that doesn’t require coding. Like system analyst, scrum master, product owner, and ideally, MANAGER! And until then, they dodged the actual coding with half-hearted solutions and very little interest in technical growth.

Instead, they would focus on improving their reporting skills. Unfortunately for them, there is a shortage of software engineers and not managers. So they might be stuck in engineering for a while, getting their reporting to extraordinarily high levels to the delight of superiors and frustration of their peers.

I was unfortunate enough to come across a few who, through their smart talk and political games, cultivated the image of a “knowledgeable expert” for their superiors who weren’t technical. Despite their spin and constant efforts to get into their superiors’ good books, their lack of technical knowledge and their “games” would drag the team’s progress down and create friction within the group.

I remember one clear example. One time, a “knowledgeable expert” that our team was unfortunate to have gone on holiday precisely for the duration of one sprint. The estimated output for that sprint was 15–20% down as we missed one developer. But, the actual output was 2.5 (250%) times more than usual.

If you notice that you don’t like software engineering, just transition to something else as soon as possible. It will be a win for everyone.

If you find yourself working with this kind of person, don’t be shy to go “technical” and challenge their proposed solutions or deliverables. You might need decent communication skills to avoid conflicts, but it could spare your team a lot of frustration in the long term.

And if you are patient, you can play his reputation against him by leaving the most difficult tasks to the “expert.” He’ll most likely fall flat on his face. And if he manages to wriggle his way out of it without the manager noticing — get the hell out of there! The situation is bad already, but having a clueless manager on top of that is beyond salvation.

That’s it. These are the most important lessons that I would like to share from what seems to be a different life now. I haven’t looked for a job or been interviewed since I sat down and carefully considered where I want to be in the long term (lesson 1).

I realised that no place would offer what I wanted, so I created my own. And now, since I have become an entrepreneur, coding is the easiest part. But entrepreneurship is not for everyone. That’s where the rest of the lessons could come in handy. And my experience as an employer only helped to shape the lessons above.
