## 1980s personal computing explosion
### December 1981, I received a Commodore Vic20, my first computer :-)

- I spent hours typing in BASIC code, line-by-line; and being completely amazed that the program worked! Usually a game.

- rereading and debugging the code when the program would not execute! I was determined that the game would work.

- there was no internet then; to ask questions to see if a similar issue was experienced by someone else. Debugging was all trial and error.

- Upgraded to a cassette drive, wahoo!

- First game Jelly Monsters. This is very Pac-Man esk. (imho best game ever)

- What was your **first computing experience** and what impact did it have on you?

- Thanks for reading
