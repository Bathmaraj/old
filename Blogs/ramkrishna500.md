## [1) HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
The HackerRank Community is first choice of every beginner and one of the largest learning and competition communities for programmers. HackerRank for Work is the leading end-to-end technical recruiting platform for hiring engineers.  HackerRank is also very addictive, once you start, you will likely spend hours solving coding problems.

More than 1 Million programmers are part of HackerRank which speaks volumes about the value it provides to programmers who want to prepare for coding interviews and improve their coding and problem-solving skills. Many tech companies also use HackerRank for arranging screening and written tests for candidates.

## [2) Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
LeetCode is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews. Pick from an expanding library of more than 450 questions, code, and submit your solution to see if you have solved it correctly. It is that easy!

This platform currently supports a total of 11 languages: C, C++, Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, Ruby, Swift, Go, Bash, MySQL. So, doesn't matter if you are a C++ developer or Java programmer, you can benefit from it.

You will find all kinds of different interview questions divided into four major categories like Algorithms, Database, and Shell Scripts. The Algorithms contain interview questions on the array, linked list, string, binary tree, graph, and others.

## [3) Geeks4Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
GeeksForGeeks is a great website that has lots of programming questions from various tech companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Flipkart, Uber, etc. It's mainly a user contribution-based website where users contribute programming questions in the form of short summaries and articles.

The GeeksForGeeks team also write an article to explain concepts that are important from the programming point of view like data structure and algorithms like Trie, Red-BlackTree, Self-Balanced Tree, etc.
