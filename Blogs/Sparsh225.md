# What is the cloud?
-Moving to the cloud. Running in the cloud. Stored in the cloud. Accessed from the cloud: these days is seems like everything is happening “in the cloud”. But what exactly is this nebulous concept?

-The short answer is that it's somewhere at the other end of your internet connection – a place where you can access apps and services, and where your data can be stored securely. The cloud is a big deal for three reasons:

-It doesn't need any effort on your part to maintain or manage it.

-It's effectively infinite in size, so you don't need to worry about it running out of capacity.

-You can access cloud-based applications and services from anywhere – all you need is a device with an internet connection.

-This is important because there's a shift going on from office-based work to working on the move. This shift is reflected in computer hardware sales: In 2015 about 270 million desktop and laptop computers will be sold, compared to 325 million tablets and almost 2 billion smartphones.

-That makes the cloud a very good place to run business software like customer relationship management (CRM) applications – software that users need to access reliably at any time, wherever they are, and on any device.

# Why Cloud?

As you take the plunge into the cloud, do the necessary research to help guide you toward the right product that best fits your needs. Typically, Cloud Computing can offer a wide range of features and benefits. Below are the top five:

Reliability – Applications are hosted on extensive networks of physical servers. If one goes down, it will have little to no effect on its availability. Pooled cloud resources make it possible to survive an entire data center going offline by spreading the risk across multiple resources.

Physical Security – The physical hardware is housed within secure, climate controlled data centers. This limits the possibility of people accessing or tampering with equipment.

Scalability – Resources are available as client needs increase. There are no delays in expanding capacity and no waste of unused physical resources.

Flexibility – Customers have control over the tools that are installed within their platforms. They can pick and choose the features they feel are necessary.

Responsive load balancing – Service can be instantly scalable to respond to changing demands. This is especially valuable for businesses with frequent spikes in activity.
