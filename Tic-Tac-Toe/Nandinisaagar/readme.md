It's the well-known game of Tic Tac Toe that we all played as kids, with the exception that we usually played it on sheetsÂ rather than on a website.



### :star: BRIEF DESCRIPTION -
The technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS and Javascript. With help of this project I came to know the effective usage of these 

technologies and implemented them in this project. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is used for structuring, in this project a file 

(indexhtml) is used for the structural layout of the website. CSS stands for the Cascading Style Sheets, it is used for describing how HTML 

elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages 

all at once. It is all saved in the file ( style.css). Lastly, Javascript ( index.js ) it is basically used to implement the logic on the 

website. It can also be said that Javascript is the brain of the website and HTML is the body.
