# Snake game

## About 
* Snake game is a simple game where a snake moves around a box trying to eat an apple. Once it successfully eats the apple, the length of the snake increases and   the movement becomes faster. Then the game is over when the snake runs into itself or any of the four walls of the box.

 * Snake is a fun game to make as it doesn't require a lot of code (less than 100 lines with all comments removed). This is a basic implementation of the snake game, but it's missing a few things intentionally and they're left as further exploration for the reader.
