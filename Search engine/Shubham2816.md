# INTRODUCTION:

Web application development is the creation of application programs that reside on remote servers and are delivered to the user's device over the Internet. A web application (web app) does not need to be downloaded and is instead accessed through a network. An end user can access a web application through a web browser such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox. A majority of web applications had been made with the help of React, CSS, JavaScript; due to easy libraries and modern techniques.
-What are the benefits of web applications?
-Web apps actually have a ton of benefits as compared to other software, so we'll just leave a list of most important of them:
#### No space limitations, since it operates in the web and not on the hard drive
#### It doesn't need huge support and maintenance investments on the business side
####	It works better with lower technical possibilities on the user's side to run normally
#### It's easier to update web applications automatically and keep the features fresh
#### Usually, users have less compatibility issues, since you just need to adapt the app to specific browsers.
#### Web applications can be accessed anywhere and be run on multiple platforms simultaneously (regardless of the OS and device).

 
## SEARCH ENGINE
In this Course we have also learnt about React, which is a JavaScript library for building user interface. Also, about Context API which is an efficient way to pass data through the component tree, many more interface libraries. React Router which used to create routing in react app, Google search API which also is a custom search JSON API. Firebase which is used to create android and IOS apps.
REACT:

React is a JavaScript-based UI development library. Facebook and an open-source developer community run it. Although react is a library rather than a language, it is widely used in web development. The library first appeared in May 2013 and is now one of the most commonly used frontend libraries for web development.
React offers various extensions for entire application architectural support, such as Flux and React Native, beyond mere UI. Easy creation of dynamic applications: React makes it easier to create dynamic web applications because it requires less coding and offers more functionality, as opposed to JavaScript, where coding often gets complex very quickly.
Since the data flows in a single direction, it becomes easier to debug errors and know where a problem occurs in an application at the moment in question. Dedicated tools for easy debugging: Facebook has released a Chrome extension that can be used to debug React applications. This makes the process of debugging React web applications faster and easier.
 
## React

Some of the features of React are as follows:
#####	Re-usability - A component used in one area of the application can be reused in another area. This helps speed up the development process.
#####	Nested Components - A component can contain several other components.
#####	Render method - In its minimal form, a component must define a render method that specifies how the component renders to the DOM.
#####	Passing properties - A component can also receive props. These are properties passed by its parent to specify values.

 ## GIT AND NODE:

Git development began in April 2005, after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access to BitKeeper, a proprietary source-control management (SCM) system that they had been using to maintain the project since 2002. The copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy, had withdrawn free use of the product after claiming that Andrew Tridgell had created SourcePuller by reverse engineering the BitKeeper protocols. 
 
## GIT

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

### REACT COMPONENTS:
Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
Few popular components of React are as follows:
#####	Class component
#####	Function component                                              
#####	Props as properties



## REACT ROUTER:

It is a well-known standard library for routing the React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.
It has a simple API with powerful features like lazy code loading, dynamic route matching, and location transition handling built right in.

## REDUX:

It creates a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It is also known to be inspired by Flux, Elm, Immutable.
React Redux is the official React binding for Redux. It allows React components to read data from a Redux Store, and dispatch Actions to the Store to update data. Redux helps apps to scale by providing a sensible way to manage state through a unidirectional data flow model.
