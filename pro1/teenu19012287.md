# This is my first PR
### I want to give some knowledge about the Machine-learning 
- Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.
- Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.
### About Datasets
- On the basis of data the machine predict the outcome
- a data set is any collection of data. It can be anything from an array to a complete database.
### Mean, Median, and Mode
- In Machine Learning (and in mathematics) there are often three values that interests us:

- Mean - The average value
- Median - The mid point value
- Mode - The most common value

### Mean
- The mean value is the average value.

- To calculate the mean, find the sum of all values, and divide the sum by the number of values:

- (99+86+87+88+111+86+103+87+94+78+77+85+86) / 13 = 89.77

### Median
- The median value is the value in the middle, after you have sorted all the values:

 - 77, 78, 85, 86, 86, 86, 87, 87, 88, 94, 99, 103, 111

### The Mode value is the value that appears the most number of times:

- 99, 86, 87, 88, 111, 86, 103, 87, 94, 78, 77, 85, 86 = 86

- The SciPy module has a method for this.
